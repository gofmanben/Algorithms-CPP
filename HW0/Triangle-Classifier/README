Niloofar Montazeri, Sept 21, 2025
-----------------------------------------------------
Code files: Makefile, main.cpp, triangle.cpp, triangle.h
Test files: test-input1.txt, test-input2.txt, ideal-output1.txt, ideal-output2.txt
Extra files: README (this file)
----------------------------------------------------
This is a simple assignment, to understand the overall pipeline we will follow
in our assignments. 
----------------------------------------------------
USAGE: 
1) Run "make", to get executable "main".
2) Run "./main <INPUT FILE> <OUTPUT FILE>"

Example:
./main test-input1.txt test-output1.txt
./main test-input2.txt test-output2.txt

Each line of INPUT FILE should have three numbers for three edges of a triangle. 
Each corresponding line of OUTPUT FILE has the class of the corresponding triangle. The classes are:
"invalid", "equilateral", "isosceles", "scalene"
