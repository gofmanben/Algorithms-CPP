README for Bard

-----------------------------------------------------
Code files: Makefile, main.cpp, linkedlist.h, linkedlist.cpp, wordlist.h, wordlist.cpp
Test files: shakespeare-cleaned.txt, simple-input.txt, simple-output.txt, Tests/more-input.txt, Tests/more-output.txt
Extra files: README (this file)
----------------------------------------------------
This is a simple assignment, to understand the overall pipeline we will follow
in our assignments. 
----------------------------------------------------
USAGE: 
1) Run "make", to get executable "main".
2) Run "./main <INPUT FILE> <OUTPUT FILE>"

Example:
./main simple-input.txt test-output.txt
./main Tests/more-input.txt test-more-output.txt

----------------------------------------------------

This program builds an in-memory data structure from the file
"shakespeare-cleaned.txt". It groups words by their length and stores them
in sorted order so they can be retrieved by rank.

After building the structure, the program reads queries from an input file.
Each query contains:

(wordLength rank)

The program outputs the word of that length at the given rank (0-indexed),
or "-" if the rank/length is invalid or no such word exists.
-----------------------------------------------------

HOW IT WORKS (HIGH LEVEL):
1) Read every word from shakespeare-cleaned.txt
2) Insert the word into a LinkedList bucket based on word length
3) Each bucket contains a WordList of words stored in sorted order
4) Then read the input queries:
   - Find the correct bucket (word length)
   - Walk forward "rank" nodes in that bucket’s WordList
   - Output the word if found, otherwise output "-"

-----------------------------------------------------

FILES EXPLANATION:
main.cpp
- Opens shakespeare-cleaned.txt and builds the data structure
- Reads query pairs (wordLength, rank) from the input file
- Writes the answer word (or "-") to the output file

linkedlist.h / linkedlist.cpp
- Implements the LinkedList of buckets
- Each bucket represents a word length (len)
- Each bucket stores a WordList of words of that length

wordlist.h / wordlist.cpp
- Implements the WordList for a specific length bucket
- Handles inserting words and storing frequency counts
- Provides access to the head node and size

shakespeare-cleaned.txt
- Text source used to build the word-frequency lists
